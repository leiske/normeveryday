And he's not dirty in this joke.  But he'd always be a hellion in class and the teacher didn't think much of him.  So the teacher has a project, not a project but an in class thing.  She says, \"now, this is what you're gonna do here, class.  I want you to stand up and tell the class a story from your life.  And then afterwards, say the moral to that story.\"\n\nSo a girl puts up her hand.  \"Yes, Becky, what's your story?\"\n\nSo Becky stands up, she goes: \"My dad works for the hatchery here in town and what happens was he's got about 15 eggs.  And he put them all in one basket, all the same basket.  So he put all his eggs in one basket.  And he put it on the horse and buggy and drove back home.\"  And \"by God\", Becky says, \"the bouncin' and all the eggs broke.\"\n\n\"Well, that's a good story,\" the teacher said, \"but what would the moral be to that?\"\n\nBecky said, \"well, the moral is: don't put all your eggs into one basket.\"\n\n\"But god damn,\" says the teacher, \"that's a good one.  Anybody else?\"\n\nMarjorie puts up her hand.  \"Marjorie, what's your story?\"\n\n\"Well, my dad works for the hatchery, as most all of us.  Thank God for the hatchery\", she says, \"or we'd all be lost.  But anyways, my dad knows that eggs become chickens and so he was counting his chickens and he added in the eggs, you see.  And then he put them on a horse and buggy to go to town and they all broke.\"\n\n\"Well, what's the lesson to that?\"  The teacher says, she can't understand.\n\nAnd she says, \"well, don't count your chickens before they hatch out of an egg.\"\n\nSo the teacher says, \"that's a great one too.  Anybody else?\"\n\nWell, wouldn't ya know, Dirty Johnny has his hand up. So the teacher's like, \"holy God, I don't want to but on the other hand I made an oath to every child should, suppose I gotta... Alright Dirty Johnny whatttaya...\"\n\nJohnny stands up.  \"Story is about my uncle Terry.  He never worked at the hatchery on account he was in Vietnam.  And he got disability.  He don't even like people work at the hatchery.  But the story happened faaaaaaaar from these shores in a little town called Danae.  Terry was not well liked.  His whole troupe left him abandoned and he woke up in the weeds and all they left him with was three bottles of Jack Daniels and some weapons.  Terry stood up and downed one bottle right away and said, 'If I'm going out, I'm going out.'  And took his Balishnikov and a couple of Glocks and his two bottles and away he went.  He found a town and he didn't know if it was Charlie or if it was one he was sent to protect.  But all he knew was he had hate in his gut.  So he started firing and he fired the Kalashnikov with an arcing kind of, like a farmer would with hay with a scythe.  And sure enough, the men fell like hay before him.  And then the women, and by God, I'm ashamed to say it, but then the children.  And finally, all was left was uncle Terry standing in the mud and the blood and the glory.  And he touched his pants and it was wet and he said he felt shame for he pissed himself.  Well, he touched it again and it was not urine at all but ejaculate.  And uncle Terry felt pride where shame once was.\" \n\nAnd the teacher was like, \"good Christ!  What kind of a story is that?!?  What the hell is the moral to that?\"\n\nHe says, \"when uncle Terry's been drinking, you don't fuck with him.  Now it's better if you work at the hatchery...\"","post":{"id":200,"description":"Co-creator of 'The Office,' 'Extras,' and 'Hello Ladies,' Stephen Merchant, joins Norm on the first episode of Season 3.","slug":"norm-macdonald-live-s03e01-norm-macdonald-with-guest"},"__typename":"Joke"},{"id":366,"joke":"A new report by the CDC reports that only one third of Americans use condoms while two thirds are still pretty cool.","post":{"id":212,"description":"Tim Allen joins Norm on the next episode of the third season of Norm Macdonald Live.","slug":"norm-macdonald-live-s03e13-norm-macdonald-with-guest"},"__typename":"Joke"},{"id":128,"joke":"Four of the top 5 picks in the NFL draft were offensive tackles which is a great thing to tell your wife as the love drains from her eyes.","post":{"id":183,"description":"Actor Nick Swardson recounts watching sports with Norm and demonstrates his new Mr. Furley impression.
